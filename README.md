I have decided to conduct a project analyzing the performance of different "meme coins" and their performance given their popularity. I was motivated to take on this research project out of interest in understanding how some cryptocurrencies become more popular than others. The intrinsic values of all cryptocurrencies are 0, but some coins made particularly popular by social media have skyrocketed in value compared to others. By understanding trends in popular cryptocurrencies and how long they stay at peak performance, it may be possible to learn how to predict performance of these coins in the future. Looking at information such as trade volume and market cap of very frequently used cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum compared with "meme coins" such as Dogecoinh and Monacoins, we can get an idea of if more value based coins show different trends compared to "meme coins". Here the independent variables are trade volume and market cap, of which we are trying analyze the relationship. The dependent variable would be the dates during which the top 50% values of trade volume also coincide with the top 50% market cap for these coins.
