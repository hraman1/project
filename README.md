I have decided to conduct a project analyzing the performance of different "meme coins" and their performance given their popularity. I was motivated to take on this research project out of interest in understanding how some cryptocurrencies become more popular than others. The intrinsic values of all cryptocurrencies are 0, but some coins made particularly popular by social media have skyrocketed in value compared to others. By understanding trends in popular cryptocurrencies and how long they stay at peak performance, it may be possible to learn how to predict performance of these coins in the future. The plan here would be to analyze opening and closing performance of the most popular and least popular coins and discerning the time frames in which these were at the highest. Looking at this information, alongside trade volume and market cap of these more popular and less popular coins, we can get an idea of if coins with higher market cap and trade volume stay at a certain transaction peak longer than coins of lower market cap. The link to the dataset for the project is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepshah16/meme-cryptocurrency-historical-data?select=Litecoin.csv .
