I plan to plot my data in the form of line graphs for each of the four chosen cryptocurrencies. The x axis of these graphs will haves dates, while the y axis on the left will have the top 50% of trade volumes and the right will have the top 50% of market cap for the coin. I plan to make these graphs in the form of ggplots.
